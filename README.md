Pebble Hearthstone Cards
========================

My first, proof of concept app for the pebble built with [Pebble.js](http://pebble.github.io/pebblejs/).

Follows the same concept as my other project, [HS Card Search](https://github.com/Dervisevic/hs-card-search) but for the Pebble. As typing is very hard on a watch this is pure lookup, it lists the cards straight up, and selecting one shows additional info. More could be done but it's not really practical, i just built it as a test.

Pebble.js is pretty great, makes building app for the Pebble so much more simple than the C library, at least for simple stuff like this.
